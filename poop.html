<h1>why my website looks like poop</h1>
<p>
    i don't really have a taste for design, and through out my life i've been
    taking people's portfolio designs and treating it as my own. i don't want to
    live like that.
    <br />
    thus until i have some original thoughts, this will stay html
</p>
