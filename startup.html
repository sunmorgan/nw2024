<h1>why my start up failed</h1>

<p>
    for those who don't know me, I tried to create my own company in the summer
    of 2024. <a href="https://tryodu.com/" target="_blank">odu</a> was a
    platform to automate medical billing for physicians in ontario with a
    <a

        target="_blank"
        >rag</a
    >
    system.
    <br />
    funny story, I got this idea from my grandma's family doctor, call him john.
    john and I were having small chats at my grandma's appointment, at the time,
    gpt came out just a couple months ago. he asked questions about me,
    naturally I
    <br />
    would ask back. john talked about a lot of admin stuff he needs to do and it
    wasted a lot of his time, and jokingly said I should make one of those ai
    things for him to do these tasks, and he'd pay me some money.
    <br />
    <br />
    the way doctors in ontario gets paid is very weird, this is the case for
    some other provinces and states as well. doctors would generally diagnose
    the patient with something, and perform some sort of procedure if needed.
    let's call diagnosis x and procedure y.
    <br />
    doctors gets paid through the
    <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Health_Insurance_Plan"
        target="_blank"
        >government</a
    >
    , and to get paid, the government wants doctors to tell them the diagnosis
    and procedures for their patients. but the government don't want those in
    words, they want it in codes. so perhaps a patient has flu,
    <br />
    their code could be something like 923. without submitting these codes,
    doctors don't get paid. problem is, the definitions for these codes are so
    long and they have different codes for different diciplines, e.g) radiology,
    family doctor.
    <a
        href="https://www.ontario.ca/files/2025-03/moh-schedule-benefit-2024-03-04.pdf"
        target="_blank"
        >here</a
    >
    <br />
    is a ~1000 page document that outlines all of the codes with their
    corresponding diagnosis and procedure codes. it's clear how this becomes a
    pain in the arse. most solutions out there were
    <a href="https://www.dr-bill.ca/">companies</a> hiring billing specialists
    that charge a small percentage
    <br />
    of the doctor's appointment in exchange for finding out the codes and
    submitting it to the government for them. this is actually a lot of money
    when accumulated over time. so I wanted to build a cheaper and more reliable
    alternative
    <br />
    <br />
    I finished the mvp pretty quickly; and I sent emails to doctors at local
    clinics and even walked in to some of them to find decision makers to talk
    to. luckily for me, my first ever cold email got my first ever user. when I
    looked at the supabase dashboard,
    <br />
    seeing a new signup made me feel so happy. I kept working on my product, and
    every week or so I would check in to see what features my user really cares
    about. then it came: doctors want a platform where they can send the codes
    directly to the
    <br />
    government(the default government platform is super ass and hard to
    navigate). after doing some researching, I need to make sure my software
    passes some sort of conformance testing, which makes sense because the data
    needs to be secure.
    <br />
    there's some guy on github that actually wrote a
    <a href="https://github.com/mykiBoy/OHIP-MCEDT-SOAP-Example" target="_blank"
        >code</a
    >
    that can pass this, so I was going just use that and host it on some vps. at
    the time I thought to myself, holy shit I'm gonna create a profitable
    company. little did I know, when applying for the conformance testing,
    <br />
    there is a point on the
    <a
        href="https://forms.mgcs.gov.on.ca/dataset/81dd4dfb-831e-493f-9e7b-f16b3c2337ab/resource/900e304d-17c7-4981-9a2c-e9c42206d348/download/4860-84e.pdf"
        target="_blank"
        >form
    </a>
    that says everytime you make a change to your software, you need to REAPPLY
    for conformance testing AGAIN. for a clueless guy that was following every
    yc advice, this was killing me. one of the startup "rules" was that
    <br />
    you need to move fast. with this policy in place, I would not be able to do
    any of that. and a lot of my joy comes from me shipping/improving features.
    I thought to myself for a while, and decided to wrap things up. I was
    already at a bad place doing business
    <br />
    in a domain that I wasn't familiar with, and with the policy I can't see
    myself keep going.
    <br />
    <br />
    on a side note, I had talks with vcs and startup accelertors (not those
    super beefy ones you'd hear about on hackernews), and they were interested
    in what I was building. though it didn't matter anymore, I wrapped this shit
    up.
